## What's Been Implemented

### March 2026 - Latest Updates
- **Nightly Champion Badge**: Added new badge awarded to #1 performer on tonight's leaderboard
  - Worth 25 bonus points
  - Automatically awarded when admin generates new QR code (new night begins)
  - Recorded in accomplishments with night_date and final nightly_points

- **Nightly Leaderboard Reset**: Implemented dual leaderboard system
  - Added "Tonight" tab showing points earned during current night only
  - Added "All-Time" tab showing total accumulated points
  - Nightly points automatically reset when admin generates a new QR code
  - WebSocket `LEADERBOARD_RESET` event notifies all connected clients when reset occurs
  - All point-awarding actions now increment both `nightly_points` and `points`

- **WebSocket Battle Notifications Fix**: Fixed critical bug where battle notifications weren't being received
  - Issue: React StrictMode was causing WebSocket connections to close immediately after opening
  - Fix: Added `isConnectingRef` and `shouldReconnectRef` flags in `useVoteNotification.js` to handle double-mount/unmount cycles
  - Verified: WebSocket now connects successfully and battle notifications (BATTLE_CHALLENGE, CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED, BATTLE_ENDED) are properly received
  - Test report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_4.json`

- **Login/Register Page Cleanup**: Removed side images from login and registration pages, now centered form design

### December 2025 - Previous Updates
- **Admin Queue Reordering**: Admins can now manually move songs up/down in the queue
  - **Drag-and-drop**: Grab the grip handle (⋮⋮) and drag songs to any position
  - Up/down arrow buttons for quick single-position moves
  - Songs that used a perk to enter top 4 positions are "frozen" and cannot be moved
  - Visual indicator (lock icon + "Perk Used" badge) for protected songs
  - POST /api/admin/queue/{item_id}/reorder endpoint for drag-and-drop

- **5 Songs per 30-Minute Window**: Checked-in users can add up to 5 songs per 30-minute rolling window
  - Window resets every 30 minutes from check-in time
  - Clear feedback on songs remaining and time until reset
  - Backend validation with helpful error messages
  - GET /api/queue/my-status endpoint provides full queue eligibility info
